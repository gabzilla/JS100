<!-- Create a document that includes a constructor function named Company in the document head area.
Include four properties in the Company object definition:
name, products, motto, and numEmployees (for number of employees.)
Instantiate a new Company object in the document body , then assign values to each of the properties
Print the name, products, motto, and the numEmployees properties to the screen using document.write methods.
